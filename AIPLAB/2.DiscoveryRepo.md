# Phase 1: Discover - File Repositories

In this section, we will run through the configuration of the AIP unified labeling scanner and show how it can be used to detect sensitive data on repositories.

## Azure Information Protection Scanner

Most modern organizations have terabytes (or petabytes) of unstructured data sitting in their on-premises data repositories and SharePoint libraries. Managing this data the way you manage other corporate resources is a daunting but achievable task using tools like the AIP scanner.

The **Azure Information Protection scanner** allows you to scan your on premises data repositories against the standard Office 365 sensitive information types and custom types you build with keywords or regular expressions. Once the data is discovered, the AIP scanner(s) can aggregate the findings and display them in Analytics reports so you can begin visualizing your data risk and see recommendations for setting up protection rules based on the content.

We will quickly walk through the installation of the AIP unified labeling scanner in this lab, but we do the full end-to-end installation with multiple scanners attached to a single profile for load balancing in another lab in this series.

## AIP Scanner Configuration

In this task, we will configure an AIP scanner, cluster, content scan job, and repository in Azure and install an AIP scanner to run in discovery mode. 

1. Minimize **AdminPC** and return to Edge on the jumphost
1. Click on the Azure Information Protection tab
2. Under **Scanner**, click **Clusters**
3. In the Scanner Clusters pane, click the **+ Add** button

4. In the Add a new cluster pane, enter **East US** for the **Cluster name** and click save.
5. In the Scanner section of the blade, click on **Content scan jobs** and click the **+ Add** button.
6. Provide a name for the Content scan job and then configure using the following settings:

	>  The default **Schedule** is set to **Manual**, and **Info types to be discovered** is set to **All**.

1. Under **Policy Enforcement**, set the **Enforce** switch to **Off**
1. Click **Save** to complete initial configuration
1. Once the save is complete, click on **Configure repositories**
1. In the Repositories blade, click the **+ Add** button

1. In the Repository blade, under **Path**, type **\\\AdminPC\Documents**
1. In the Repository blade, click **Save**
	
	>NOTE: Keep the Azure Portal window available for future hands on sections.
1. On the desktop, restore **AdminPC** 
2. Open an **Administrative PowerShell Window** and type the PowerShell commands below.

	```PowerShell
	Install-AIPScanner -SqlServerInstance <name> -Profile <cluster name>
	```
	For name input the machine the SQL Server Instance is running on, which in this case is "**AdminPC**".
	For Profile type in the cluster name in quotations as well.
	
3. When prompted, log in using your scanner service account (<domain\user name>)

4. Verify that the service is now installed by using **Administrative Tools > Services**. The installed service is named Azure Information Protection Scanner and is configured to run by using the scanner service account that you created.

Next we will be obtaining admin consent necessary to run the AIP client unattended. This will be done by obtaining an Azure AD Token. 

1. Navigate back to the Azure Portal and proceed to the **Azure Active Directory** Blade.
2. In the Azure Active Directory side pane, click **App Registrations**.
3. At the top, go ahead and click **+ New registration**.
4. In the Name section type in "AIPScanner".
5. Leave Supported account types as default.
6. For the Redirect URI, leave the type as Web but type in "http://localhost" for the entry portion and click **Register**.
7. On the Overview page of this application, note down in your text editor of choice the following IDs: **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID**
8. On the side pane, navigate to **Certificates and Secrets**
9. Click on **+ New client secret**
10. In the dialog box that shows up, enter a description for your secret and set it to Expire **In 1 year** and then Add the secret.
11. You should see now under the client secrets section that there is an entry with the Secret Value. Go ahead and copy this value and store it in the file where you saved the Client ID and Tenant ID.
12. On the side pane, navigate to **API Permissions**
13. Go ahead and select **Add a permission**.
14. When the screen shows, select **Azure Rights Management Service**. Then select **Application Permissions**.
15. Click the drop down for **Content** and put checkmarks down for **Content.DelegatedReader** and **Content.DelegatedWriter**. Then at the bottom of the screen, click **Add Permissions**.
16. Navigate back the **API Permissions** section and add another permission.
17. This time, for the Select an API section, click on **APIs my organization uses**. In the search bar, type in **Microsoft Information Protection Sync Service**
18. Select **Application Permissions** and then in the **Unified Policy** drop down, checkmark the permission **UnifiedPolicy.Tenant.Read**. Then at the bottom of the screen, click **Add Permissions**.
19. Back on the **API Permissions** screen, click **Grant Admin Consent** and look for the operation being successful (signified by a green checkmark). 
20.Navigate back to the **Administrative PowerShell Window** in **AdminPC**
21. Type in the following command:
	```PowerShell
	$pscreds = Get-Credential CONTOSO\scanner
	Set-AIPAuthentication -AppId "77c3c1c3-abf9-404e-8b2b-4652836c8c66" -AppSecret "OAkk+rnuYc/u+]ah2kNxVbtrDGbS47L4" -DelegatedUser scanner@contoso.com -TenantId "9c11c87a-ac8b-46a3-8d5c-f4d0b72ee29a" -OnBehalfOf $pscreds
Acquired application access token on behalf of CONTOSO\scanner.
	```
	For name input the machine the SQL Server Instance is running on, which in this case is "**AdminPC**".
	For Profile type in the cluster name in quotations as well.


1. On the desktop, right-click on **Grant-AdminConsentUL.ps1** and select **Copy**
2. Minimize AdminPC and **Paste** the script on the jumphost desktop
3. Right-click on **Grant-AdminConsentUL.ps1** and select **Run with PowerShell**

	>Type **Y** to accept the execution policy change
1. Press **Enter** in the window to launch the browser
2. In the new tab that is opened, under **Grant consent**, click **Grant admin consent for Contoso**
3. Click **Yes** in the confirmation prompt

	>You will see the status change from warning symbols to green checks
4. Close this tab and return to **AdminPC**
5. Right-click on **Set-AIPAuthenticationUL.ps1** and select **Run with PowerShell**
6. When prompted, enter the AIP Scanner service credentials below:

	> **Contoso\AIPScanner**
	>
	> **Somepass1**

1. Finally, in the Admin PowerShell window, type **Restart-Service AIPScanner**
	
This is an intentionally quick and simple deployment of the AIP scanner due to limited time in the lab environment.  After the script completes, a discovery scan is started and results will be reported to AIP Analytics if configured.  The image below shows the result of a discovery scan in the AIP Analytics dashboard.

In this section, we have learned how to do discovery on File repositories using the AIP scanner. 

In the next section, we will discuss classification and labeling and strategies for developing your classification taxonomy.
