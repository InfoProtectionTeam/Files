# Setting up your Lab Environment

In this section we will learn how to set-up our ***Build-Your-Own-Lab Environments***. As shown in the intro, we will use a script that is based off of the AutomatedLab framework to create 3 machines - ContosoDC, AdminPC, and ClientPC. In addition to creating these machines, we also get many of the dependencies pre-installed, such as the Domain Controller already set up in ContosoDC, SQL Server and Office ProPlus in AdminPC along with **Azure Information Protection Unified Labeling Client**, and ClientPC again with Office ProPlus and the **Azure Information Protection Unified Labeling Client**. 

## Where to Begin

First you need to decide between the two options for BYOL which is either creating your machines through your local HyperVisor or with Microsoft Azure. 

You can find the HyperV Script [here](AIPBYOL-HyperV.ps1) and the Azure script [here](AIPBYOL-Azure.ps1).

## AutomatedLab Framework

The AutomatedLab Framework (https://github.com/AutomatedLab) was used to create this lab set-up. As a prequisite for getting started, you must use the following PowerShell Commands on your PowerShell ISE as administrator to have the right modules to run the rest of the lab:

	```powershell
	Install-PackageProvider Nuget -Force
	Install-Module AutomatedLab -AllowClobber
	New-LabSourcesFolder -Drive C
	Install-Module Az
	```

## HyperV Specific Instructions

Follow the steps outlined in the HyperV BYOL script. As a prerequisite, if you are building this particular lab you want to have the HyperV tools installed on your machine before running the script. You should be able to do this by turning on the relevant feature. You can do this by typing in your start menu "Turn Windows features on or off" and clicking the option for this screen:

Make sure the checked box appears next to Hyper-V. After the box is checked, be sure to restart your computer.

Then you should be able to run through the rest of the script.
