# Setting up your Lab Environment

**Azure Information Protection** (as described in the introduction) is one part of the larger **Microsoft Information Protection** story.  With Microsoft Information Protection, Microsoft is streamlining how all applications that require information protection capabilities interact.  This provides a **unified interface** where both Microsoft and Partner applications can **classify and protect sensitive information**. 

Ultimately, this means better integration across our information protection solutions and a more consistent approach to protecting your sensitive data.
